"""Deterministic reconstruction of the j(x) in a JJ from a Fraunhofer pattern.

The method implemented here is based on:
Dynes, R. C. & Fulton, T. A.
Supercurrent Density Distribution in Josephson Junctions.
Phys. Rev. B 3, 3015â€“3023 (1971).

This method has the advantage of being algebraic but can suffer from a lack of
precision due to the finite extend of the measured Fraunhofer pattern.

We need to use the more complex approach of the paper since we are interested
in non-symmetric current distributions.

    ----------
    fields : np.ndarray
        Magnetic field at which the critical current was measured. For ND input
        the sweep should occur on the last axis.

        Measured value of the critical current. For ND input the sweep should

        use the more precise Romberg integration method instead of the Simpson
        one. The default is True.
