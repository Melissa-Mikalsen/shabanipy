"""Deterministic reconstruction of the j(x) in a JJ from a Fraunhofer pattern.

The method implemented here is based on:
Dynes, R. C. & Fulton, T. A.
Supercurrent Density Distribution in Josephson Junctions.
Phys. Rev. B 3, 3015â€“3023 (1971).

This method has the advantage of being algebraic but can suffer from a lack of
precision due to the finite extend of the measured Fraunhofer pattern.

We need to use the more complex approach of the paper since we are interested
in non-symmetric current distributions.
