"""Deterministic reconstruction of the j(x) in a JJ from a Fraunhofer pattern.

The method implemented here is based on:
Dynes, R. C. & Fulton, T. A.
Supercurrent Density Distribution in Josephson Junctions.
Phys. Rev. B 3, 3015â€“3023 (1971).

This method has the advantage of being algebraic but can suffer from a lack of
precision due to the finite extend of the measured Fraunhofer pattern.

We need to use the more complex approach of the paper since we are interested
in non-symmetric current distributions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fields : np.ndarray
        Magnetic field at which the critical current was measured. For ND input
        the sweep should occur on the last axis.
    ics : np.ndarray
        Measured value of the critical current. For ND input the sweep should
        occur on the last axis.
    use_interpolation : bool, optional
        Allow to resample the points using spline interpolation. This allows to
        use the more precise Romberg integration method instead of the Simpson
        one. The default is True.
