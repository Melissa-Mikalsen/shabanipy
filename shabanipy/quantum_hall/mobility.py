    Parameters
    ----------
    field : np.ndarray
        Magnetic field values for which the the longitudinal resistance was
        measured.
        This can be a multidimensional array in which case the last
        dimension will be considered as the swept dimension.
    rxx : np.ndarray
        Longitudinal resistance values which were measured along xx.
        This can be a multidimensional array in which case the last dimension
        will be considered as the swept dimension.
    ryy : np.ndarray
        Longitudinal resistance values which were measured along yy.
        This can be a multidimensional array in which case the last dimension
        will be considered as the swept dimension.
    density : float | np.ndarray
        Carriers density. If field is more than 1D the shape of this array
        should match the field.shape[:-1]

    Returns
    -------
    mobility : np.ndarray
        Array (2, ...) containing the xx and yy mobility
